# Code Challenge 17

## Authors: Brandyn Vay, Adrienne Easton

## Challenge

## Authors: Brandyn Vay, Adrienne Easton

## Challenge
  * Write a function called `find-maximum-value` which takes binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

# Code Challenge 33

## Authors: Brandyn Vay

## Challenge
  * Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
  * The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
  * The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
  * Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
  * LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, they are appended to the result row. If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.
  * The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesn’t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic.

# Hash Tables

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

  * `add`: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
  * `get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
  * `contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
  * `hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(1)

## API
1. Hash Table
  * `add()`
  * `get()`
  * `contains()`
  * `hash()`
